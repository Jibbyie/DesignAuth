            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
                Our goal at Sustainable Travel is to completely transform worker and student commutes by making them
                healthier, more environmentally friendly, and more sustainable. We are here to help you make that
                decision because we think that every journey can help create a cleaner planet.
            </p>
            <p>
                The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially Goals #11: Sustainable Cities and
                Communities and #13: Climate Action, serve as a direct inspiration for our work. We are contributing to
                the development of a future in which cities are not just operational but also ecologically conscious by
                encouraging eco-friendly travel practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our offerings, which range from interactive route planning tools to cycling campaigns, enable people to
                take action and change the world one journey at a time.

                <p id="mission">
                    Our goal is straightforward but significant: to lessen dependency on conventional modes of
                    transportation by offering affordable, practical, and environmentally friendly travel options. Our
                    goal is to establish a culture of mindful commuting that puts the health of people and the
                    environment first via education, involvement, and action.
                </p>
                <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                <p id="vision">
                    In our ideal future, environmentally sustainable travel will be the rule rather than the exception.
                    We are creating resilient cities, healthier communities, and a society where everyone can live in
                    peace with the environment by encouraging sustainable practices now.
